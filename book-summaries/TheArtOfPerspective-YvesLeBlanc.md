### The Art of Perspective

Perspective is an attempt to "flatten" what we see on a sheet of paper. It links graphic combinations together to explain space, just as language links words to explain thought.

* about establishing an interplay between spatial reasoning and visual disorder, organising information and providing a viewpoint:

> rendering a space "graphic" and graphics "spatial".

Drawing is a delightful learning experience we take time to see, understand and memorize our surroundings.


#### Parameters of Perspective

Seeing is a sensory activity which is both deductive and projective.

Deductive: has a strong power of intellectual resolution: the brain disentangles visual disorder, gives order to perception and coordinates reactions. From cells to neurones, the body takes in its environment with al the pragmatism of an organ whose sole objective is functional efficiency.

Projective: we must create and idea of the spaces we have not conquered physically.

> perspective is a cerebral perambulation that enables us to take possession of space intellectually.


Understanding is more important than applications: it allows the artist to master the relationship between space adn his representation of it.


* line of sight = center of picture.
* when the line of sign is horizontal, the horizon is always in teh center of the picture.

#### Frontal perspective

* depth: leads towards the centre of the image.
* width: will never meet the drawing area.
* height: will also never meet the drawing area.
* The horizon is defined by the artist's eye level.

Vanishing point: the point towards which all straight lines leading in a given direction seem to recede. For the artist it's a point of convergence, but for the person looking at the picture it's a direction.

In a frontal perspective the vanishing points converge towards the center of the composition. The surfaces facing the artist (the frontal surfaces) are not subject to foreshortening; only depth is subject to the effect of perspective. To evaluate distance, the artist uses the projection of dimensions in relation to the horizon and techniques involving the subdivision of space.

* measuring height: from the horizon line, which represents the artist's eye level.
* measuring width: by rotating height through 90 degree in the frontal plane from a reference point on the ground.
* scale of heights: makes it possible to project any point of the space at a determined height.
* subdividing a surface: relative depth can be obtained by dividing up a known measurement.


Objects that are further away from us take up less space in our field of vision: prominent edges seem less sharp and contours are less marked (distant objects appear smaller). Drawing something close to or at a distance requires the artist to focus his attention on part of his field of vision that varies in length, but where left and right appear fixed.

Rabatment is a systematic process that makes it possible to position any point in perspective through the intersection of 2 construction lines at 45 degree of each other.

Triangle equilibrium: triangle established between the points which each define one of the three dimensions of the space drawn.

> a credible perspective drawing starts with reasonable conditions of observation.

* A circle in perspective is an ellipse.
* The shadow of a point is found where the incidence and the orientation of the light intersect.

Egocentric view: the space is considered from the artist's position and his awareness of life up to that point.

Kinaesthetic: relating to the sensations of the body and its movements in space.

Reflective view: the space is recreated with no consideration for volume.

Allocentric view: the space is set up according to rules common to all potential observers.

paradigmatic view: the space is 'scanned', a bit like leafing through a catalogue.
