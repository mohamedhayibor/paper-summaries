#### Hooked

Habits: automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues. (behaviors done with little or no conscious thought".

The hook model:

1. Trigger
2. Action
3. Variable Reward
4. Investment

Habits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating over what to do next.

Too many choices or irrelevant options can cause hesitation, confusion, or worse abandonment.

### Trigger

Internal triggers manifest automatically in your mind. Connecting internal triggers with a product is the brass ring of consumer technology.

In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.

The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user's pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company's product or service as the source of relief.

### Action

To initiate action, doing must be easier than thinking. (a habit is a behavior done with little or no conscious thought)

Initiating behaviors - Fogg

1. user must have sufficient motivation
2. user must have the ability to complete the desired action
3. a trigger must be present to activate the behavior

Motivation: "the energy of action" - Edward Deci

Any technology or product that significantly reduces the steps to complete a task will enjoy high adoption rates by the the people it assists.
