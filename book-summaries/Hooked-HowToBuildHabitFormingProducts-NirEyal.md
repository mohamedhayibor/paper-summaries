#### Hooked

Habits: automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues. (behaviors done with little or no conscious thought".

The hook model:

1. Trigger
2. Action
3. Variable Reward
4. Investment

Habits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating over what to do next.

Too many choices or irrelevant options can cause hesitation, confusion, or worse abandonment.

Internal triggers manifest automatically in your mind. Connecting internal triggers with a product is the brass ring of consumer technology.

In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.

The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user's pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company's product or service as the source of relief.
