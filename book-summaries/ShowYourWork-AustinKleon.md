Show your Work
=============

"Creativity is not a talent, it is a way of operating." John Cleese

### Problem

Crafting something is a long and uncertain process.

### Solution

A maker should show her work every day.

## Chapters

### You don't have to be a genius

> Find a scenius.

"Figure out, what you have to contribute. - The ideas you share, the quality of the connections you make, and the conversations you start."

Nobody owes you shit.

"Stop asking what others can do for you. Ask what you can do for others."


###### Be an amateur

"Amateurs know that contribute something is better than contributing nothing".

> Pay attention to what others are sharing. Look out for the voids you could help fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first.

* Wear your amateurism on your sleeve.
* Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.
* Raw enthusiasm is contagious.

PS: Amateurs have something to contribute. "They sometimes explain things better, because they have encountered a problem pretty recently."


###### Don't cease outputting, that's how you find keep your voice.

* It is a matter of existing or not existing.
* If your work is not online, then it doesn't exist.
* It's a matter of life and death, each seconds are falling away.

###### Read obituaries > Think about near-death experiences every morning.

"I'm not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I'm going to make them happen, and if people think I'm an idiot I don't care." Wayne Coyne


### Think process, not product

* The work is all that's happened in the day.
* It is process, not a thing. "Remember, it is messy."

###### Document, what you do

* Write your thoughts down in a notebook / laptop.
* Keep a scrapbook.

Extras:

* Take photographs of your work.
* Shoot a video of you working.

> This is keeping what's going on around you.

### Share something small every day > send out daily dispatch

* Forget about months or weeks, think in days.
* Find time for (things) your work.
* Don't show pics of your lunch, latte... show your work.
* Work while the world is sleeping. Share while the world is at work.

> Sturgeon's law: "90% of everything is crap".

Share through the lens of generosity:

> Is it helpful or interesting, if not don't. Not sure, wait 24 hours.

**Use the "So What" test**

###### Turn your flow into Stock (Compound interest)

"If you work on something a little every day, you end up with something that is massive." Kenneth Goldsmith

Flow is the stream that let people know that you exist. Stock is the durable stuff.

> The magic formula is to maintain your flow while working on your stock in the background.

(With your daily routine), you'll find patterns in your flow. Start gathering these bits and pieces and turn them into something bigger and more substantial.

> Don't be a hoarder, share everything, so that everyday you have to create/invent.

### Open your cabinet of curiosities (lightbulb moment of my own > can you NFT this out?)

We all have our own treasured collections. They can be physical cabinets of curiosities, say, living room bookshelves, novels, records, movies....

"We all carry around the weird and wonderful things we've come across while doing our work and living our lives."

###### Why???

> "These mental scrapbooks form our tastes, and our tastes influence our work."

Our tastes make us what we are, but they can also cast a shadow over our own work.

"All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste." Ira Glass.

"You're only as good as your record collection" DJ Spooky

**Your influences are all worth sharing because they clue people in to who you are and what you do - sometimes more than your work.**

###### (No guilty pleasures) Love your garbage > try to see it in a different light

You have to have the courage to keep loving your garbage, because what makes us unique is the diversity and breadth of our influences, the unique ways in which we mix up the parts of culture.

###### Learn to StoryTell

Our work doesn't speak for itself. Human beings want to know where things came from, how they were made, who made them.

> How people feel, understand about your work effects how they value it.

###### Structure is everything

A good structure is tidy, sturdy, and logical.

Emma coats' template:

"Once upon a time, there was a ... Every day, .... One day, ... Because of that, ... Because of that, ... Until finally..." 
###### Get hearts, not eyeballs

Being good at things is the only thing that earns you clout or connections.
