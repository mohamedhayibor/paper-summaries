## The Curve - Nicholas Lovell

The future of business is about variation:

> tailoring products for customers of all stripes, and letting your biggest fans spend as much as they like on things they value.

Value lies in how you make people feel, by building communities, bespoke products and experiences.

> Small numbers of high spenders are enough to fuel a profitable business.

With only one price point available for producers, they had to make their best guess of how much someone would pay for a product and hope that they got it right.

Humans just aren't good at accepting that something that was once scarce is now abundant. We are wired to understand scarcity better than abundance.
