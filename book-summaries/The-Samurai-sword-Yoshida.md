# The Samurai Sword

Zen teaching encourages living faithfully to your heart.

* Stay true to yourself otherwise you are not truly living with integrity. (Adhering... will bring calmness and peacefulness to your heart.)
* life is not really about how long we live, it's more about how we live.

> "A man possesses extraordinary skills and lives to serve his heart".

##### When the strength in your heart flows out, things will become complete and the completion will bring harmony.

### Koh Ryu Do

Koh: Light.

Ryu: Flow.

Do: The avenue through your heart. Way.

> Light flows out of your heart.

The term Shido means "The Way of the Samurai". The ultimate warrior's code of honor, the way is to "protect your truth". Never betray yourself. A samurai would choose death over living with an untrue heart.


### Shi Fuu: Samurai Manners: "the wind of the Samurai"

* wisdom: Sharpen your wisdom, so that you can see what you need to do in the bigger picture.
* love: Connect with the universe, so that you will understand others as your fellows.
* courage: Understand life, so that fear will be a friend of your heart.


The samurai believed that you respect your enemy because he is reflecting a version of yourself.

* Samurai code: you will either win or lose with beauty and dignity.
* Samurai believed that their karma and their opponent's karma brought them together.

> The heart is wiser than the mind.

Yukimura Nobushige Sanada: "If you just focus on personal desire and gain, and not on respecting the value of grace and duty how can we think of you as a human being"

Ryoma Naonari Sakamoto: "A hero is a man who lives on his own path."

Shyoin Norikata Yoshida: "Samurai will respect ethics, not talent. And respect action, not knowledge."

In the principle of Yin and Yang, every action has a reaction. if the left had is pulling, then the right hand is pushing and vice versa.

> "Your spear goes against your own shield - the battle is a beautiful contradiction"

The contradiction is that we know that fighting is not good, yet we need to have conflicts to refine ourselves.

Birth and death are always with us, so focus on being luminous by understanding life.

"If the hawk is educated, he does not show his claw unless he needs to."

### Mental Conditioning

###### Mokusou: silent or quiet thought.

It's good to neutralize (clean up) the distracting "noisy" thoughts from your mind. Your thoughts are "vibrations" made by your brain.

The purpose of mokusou if to re-condition the brain to keep good "vibrations" and let you do what you need to do without having chaos in your mind.

> The whole condition of combat is a contradiction. This is because in one way combat asks you to stay calm and in control while on the other hand you need to be alert and aggressive.

Before training the purpose of `mokusou` is to clear your mind from your regular life routine in order to release your extra tension. This also prepares you to focus and accept everything you will learn during your lesson.

After training, Mokusou will bring calmness to your heart as you re-enter your regular life routine without holding onto the anxiety from practice.

###### Meisou (deeper form of meditation)

Performed with sunlight or candlelight. Done facing the sun or not as you keep your eyes half opened (hangan). This allows you to take the sunlight into you.

> Effective cleansing of your body and spirit as sunlight is the life force.

Chakras are life energy spots (ligth spots). They are connections between our physical body and spiritual body.

* mokusou: reorganizing
* meisou: purifying

> Beautiful things are endowed with strength, and it teaches us to be at harmony with nature.

###### Honor with your heart, and aim for glory with Ambition and Persistence
