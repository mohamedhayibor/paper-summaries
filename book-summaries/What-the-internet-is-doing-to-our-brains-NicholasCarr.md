What we learn as we live is embedded in the ever-changing cellular connections inside our heads.

Hebb's rule: "Cells that fire together wire together."

Thanks to the ready adaptability of neurons, the senses of hearing and touch can grow sharper to mitigate the effects of the loss of sight.

When it comes to the quality of our thought, our neurons and synapses are entirely indifferent. The possibility of intellectual decay is inherent in the malleability of our brains.

Every technology is an expression of human will. Through our tools, we seek to expand our power and control over our circumstances - over nature, over time and distance, over one another.

The use of any kind of tool can influence our thoughts and perspectives. ... They are our most intimate tools, the ones we use for self-expression, for shaping personal and public identity, and for cultivating relations with others.

Civilization has assumed its current form as a result of the technologies people have come to use.
