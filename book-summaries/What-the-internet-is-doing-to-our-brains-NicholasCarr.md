What we learn as we live is embedded in the ever-changing cellular connections inside our heads.

Hebb's rule: "Cells that fire together wire together."

Thanks to the ready adaptability of neurons, the senses of hearing and touch can grow sharper to mitigate the effects of the loss of sight.

When it comes to the quality of our thought, our neurons and synapses are entirely indifferent. The possibility of intellectual decay is inherent in the malleability of our brains.

Every technology is an expression of human will. Through our tools, we seek to expand our power and control over our circumstances - over nature, over time and distance, over one another.

The use of any kind of tool can influence our thoughts and perspectives. ... They are our most intimate tools, the ones we use for self-expression, for shaping personal and public identity, and for cultivating relations with others.

Civilization has assumed its current form as a result of the technologies people have come to use.

The depth of intelligence hinges on our ability to transfer information from working memory to long term memory and weave it into conceptual schemas.

The information flowing into our working memory at any given moment is called "cognitive load". When the load exceeds our mind's ability to store adn process information -- we are unable to retain information or to draw connections with the information already stored in our long term memory. We can't translate the new information into schemas. Our ability to learn suffers, and our understanding remains shallow.

... Experiments indicate that as we reach the limits of our working memory, it becomes harder to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant, signal from noise. (mindless consumer of data)

Frequent interruptions scatter our thoughts, weaken our memory, and make us tense and anxious. The more complex the train of thought we're involved in, the greater the impairment the distractions cause.

Switching between the 2 tasks short-cicuited their understanding; they got the job done, but they lost its meaning.


Jordan Grafman: "The more you multitask, the less deliberative you become; the less able to think adn reason out a problem." You become more likely to rely on conventional ideas and solutions rather than challenging them with original lines of thought.

What the net diminishes is Johnson's primary kind of knowledge: the ability to know, in depth, a subject for ourselves, to construct within our own minds the rich and idiosyncratic set of connections that give rise to a singular intelligence.

Kandel: "For a memory to persist the incoming information must be thoroughly and deeply processed. This is accomplished by attending to the information and associating it meaningfully and systematically with knowledge already well established in memory."

Attention may seem ethereal -- a "ghost inside the head"
