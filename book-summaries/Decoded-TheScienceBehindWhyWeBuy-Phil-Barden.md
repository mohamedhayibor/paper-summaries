Strong brands have a real effect in the brain, and this effect is to enable intuitive and rapid decision making without thinking.

"What fires together wires together": our brain builds associative connections between signals when they appear at the same time or space and when this simultaneous appearance happens repeatedly over time.

* Implicit associative learning enables us to efficiently make sense of the signals we percieve.
* It's not only signals from the outside world but also our own internal states that change our choices, decisions and behaviour as well.
* The autopilot manages the majority of perceptions, expectations, attitudes and motivational driversunderlying purchase decisions.

[From experiment] cleaning is implicitly linked with guilt and morality.

2 decision-making systems at work in any decision:

* implicit system working like an auto-pilot
* explicit system operating like a pilot

> To maximize net value we need to maximize both the explicit and the implicit value.

The are 2 types of costs: monetary and [behavioural costs include the amount of time and effort required to obtain a reward.]

Perception is an active process: our brain actively constructs what we perceive.


Our brain learns best when we can integrate new knowledge into pre-existing knowledge.

> Without newness only existing associations will be activated, and nothing is learned. Newness opens the door for new things to be communicated. 

The more certain the perceived reward, the better and the more certain the loss prevention, the better.

> Goals can be activated and pursued on autopilot.

The ability to automatically and implicitly recognize patterns and rules in our environment is a fundamental aspect of human cognition.

Deconstructing the product experience into its perceivable entities provides a powerful springboard for developing relevant unique and credible value propositions.
