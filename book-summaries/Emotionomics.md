# Emotionomics - Leveraging emotions

"A man makes a decision for two reasons - the good reason and the real reason." J P Morgan

Rational reasons don't win people over.

3 parts of the brain: sensory, emotional, rational

People decision making process is primarily quick, emotional and quick. People feel before they think.

* Emotion drives reason more than reason drives emotion.
* Conscious thought is only a small portion of mental activity.
* Visual imagery and other non-verbal forms of communication predominate.
* Recall is emotion-based.
* We have gut reactions in 3 seconds or less.

Mahrabian statistics:

* 55% of communication comes through facial expressions
* 38% through tone of voice
* 7% through verbal exchange

Emotions colour perceptions and inhibit change.

* Framing: making a choice more attractive by deliberately comparing it with inferior options.
* Mental accounting: placing artificial limits on the amounts we're willing to spend in certain categories.
* Prospect theory: judging pleasure based on a change in condition rather than on how happy we are.
* Anchoring: evaluating new information strictly in terms of what our baseline of knowledge happens to be.
* Recency: giving undue weight to recent experiences.
* Familiarity: bias towards the status quo.
* New-risk premium: inflating the cost of accepting new risk while discounting familiar risks
* Fear of regret: not making a decision, to avoid making a mistake.
* Decision paralysis


"Negative emotions are linked to survival - and are much stronger" LeDoux

What's "**hard to understand**" doesn't get purchased.

"It's only shallow people who do not judge the world by appearances". Oscar wilde

* The highest level of offer design is to create a story-like experience.
* Great packaging is about eyeballs and fingertips, leveraging sight and touch.
* A great offer design has a pay-off for each part of our three-part brain.
* An offer that taxes our emotional resources isn't going to be viable for long.
