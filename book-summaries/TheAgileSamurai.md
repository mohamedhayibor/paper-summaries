### The Agile Samurai

Team velocity: how much you can get done per iteration.

Agile principle: Working software is the primary measure of success.

Analysis, coding, design and testing are continuous activities - they never end.

The agile dev team is cross-functional, can take any feature the customer wants and turn it into production-ready working software.

Agile analyst:

* Helps write user stories
* Does the detailed analysis
* makes sure it's done right

Agile Programmer:

* Turns user stories into working software
* Estimates (with the rest of the team)
* Makes technical decisions

Agile Tester:

* Helps write tests for upcoming stories
* Confirms stories work as expected
* Thinks about the big testing picture

> tests: exploratory, stress, load, security, integration

Agile PM:

* Tracks how we are doing
* Communicates the state of the project
* Removes roadblocks standing in the team's way

The Drucker exercise

* what am I good at?
* how do I perform?
* what do I value?
* What results can you expect me to deliver?

> The assumption of consensus where none exists is what kills most projects
