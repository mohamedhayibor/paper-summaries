### Have your Cake and Eat it too.

Service design: to deliver a positive customer experience at all points of interaction between a company and a customer.


##### Managing expectations

A good customer experience comes down to managing expectations.

Managing expectations means providing relevant and reliable information at every step of the customer service process.

To design something means to "give form" to something, to model ideas into something that can be experienced.

A problem-solving discipline:

* Understandability
* Usability
* Distinction
* Aesthetics

> As people, we are attracted to attractive people. Similarly pleasing shapes and balanced colors help us to feel comfortable and happy.

Human behavior will always be shaped by thought models, and it is difficult to change behavior before you understand the initial reasoning behind it.

To change behavior, you must understand "why":

* Customer journey mapping
* Validating assumptions
* Touchpoint mapping
* Touchpoint matrix and improvement hierarchy

Design is an iterative process and the cycle of doing, evaluating, and improving may need to be repeated several times before it is finished.


##### Tidbits

* Things should work the way people expect them to work.
* Cheaper service is not better service.
* Quality is universal. The difference is no longer in what companies do. The competitive advantage comes from how they do it.
* A well-designed product is first and foremost a usable product.
* It is easier not to choose than to try to choose among a multitude of incomprehensible versions.

> Asking "why" is one of the qualities of a good designer.
