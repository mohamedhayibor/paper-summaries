#### [From Gamasutra](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/VictorManrique/20130618/194563/Gamification_Design_Framework_The_SMA_Model.php)

A gamified experience relies on 4 questions:

Why   -> Goal
What  -> Actions
Who   -> Players
How   -> System

### Why

> make the connections > invoke powerful emotions: freedom, power, joy, anger, wonder, courage, mistery, risk.

1. Get better results
2. Going viral
3. Increasing time spent & engagement
