BF: Byzantine Fault (a failure in which a node remains functional, but operates in a dishonest manner)

BFT: Byzantine Fault Tolerant

> Byzantine (meaning malicious, lying, ... bad intents)

DAG: Directed Acyclic Graph

DBFT: Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (generally consensus algorithm to guarantee fault tolerance)

IPFS: Inter-Planetary File System
IPNS: Inter-Planetary Name Space

MDAG: Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph
NFS: Network File System

PBFT: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance [or] Proof of BFT

POLA: Principles of Least Authority
POW: Proof Of Work

VRF: Verifiable Random Function

> allows a verifier to check with negligible effort that a prover has expanded a large amount of computational effort. (ie using computing power to handle fault tolerance)


POS: Proof Of Stake (using network consensus to handle fault tolerance)

SFS: Self-Certified Filesystems


State machine replication == atomic broadcast
