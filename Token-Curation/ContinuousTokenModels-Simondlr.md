##### [Continuous Token Models - simondlr](https://media.consensys.net/exploring-continuous-token-models-towards-a-million-networks-of-value-fff153175776) 

"The idea is that instead of pre-selling tokens during a launch phase, the tokens are minted as needed through various means. The tokens are then dispensed for services rendered in the network." 

Example token model:

* Use eth to mint a token according to a price set by a hard-coded algorithm.
* The cost of the token increases the more of it is in circulation.
* The tokens are destroyed for actions in the network. (decrease supply and cost of token)
* Tokens can be bought in secondary markets (too high, or if owner doesn't want to use it)


##### Beneficiary Models

1. Burning Eth

Exchanging eth for a specific token. (less supply, same demand)

2. Independent (pre-paid) Dynamic Beneficiaries

Allows the person who mints the token to pay anyone they wish. The rational interest of the buyer would be to pay a beneficiary that will make their newly minted token worth something now and into the future.

* issue: the ability for people to pay themeselves and keep minting a token. > making it expensive for others to join the network. (aka buying all tickets and not letting anyone enjoy/see a show)

3. Voted Dynamic Beneficiaries

The Eth is sent to a contract that has a leaderboard. Using the minted tokens itself, the community "votes" on who should get it.

> After some time, the funds are distributed automatically to the leaderboard.

3. Multisig Beneficiary

A group receives the Eth and has to sign off who the funds go to. It can either be a centralized decision making or could combine it with the voted beneficiaries.

> The multi-sig entity has to decide if it will conform to the wishes of the community.

4. DAO Beneficiary

Similar to the multi-sig, but with dynamic voting. (You have to sell ownership in the DAO, essentially creating a limited supply voting token.)


##### Caveats

Continuous Token Models (CTM) still provide reasonable speculation and ownership interest. (buy now at a discount, dispose or sell later at a higher price)

##### Killer Thoughts

* Ability to quantify all information and their network effects (memes).
* a different approach to quantifying interest in networks of value (protocols, communities, organisations, people)


* Rewarding multiple beneficiaries for development of a project without their permission
* Aiding social coodination around common goals
* Networks allowed to grow and die naturally (naturally tied to interest)
* Mass, global, economic coordination
