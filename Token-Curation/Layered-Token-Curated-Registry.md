**cryptographic building block**

Replace the rather harsh binary (in or out) approach to TCRs with step by step increase in rights and responsibilities as the actor adds more value and stake.

(agents can increase their rank (layer), ... more rights, responsibilities)

Potential:

* smooth onboarding
* help maintain actor diversity
* problems of access control, governance, identity, reputation...
