A token-curated registry uses an intrinsic token to assign curation rights proportional to the relative token weight of entities holding the token.

ie: Token-curated registries are decentrally-curated lists intrinsic economic incentives for token holders to curate the list's contents judiciously.

3 user types (interests | incentives | interaction patterns):

* consumers: high quality information.
* candidates: attention and consideration of consumers.
* token holders: keep demand for the token they hold high (as this increases the price).

> the engine of a cryptoeconomic game which curates a token-curated registry.

#### Main dynamic for high quality:

"To make a token-curated registry work, candidates must make a deposit denominated in the registry’s intrinsic token to be considered for listing. If a candidate is “good” and accepted as a listee they keep this deposit, and may withdraw it at any time should they desire to terminate their listing. If a candidate is “bad” its application may be challenged by token holders and, if rejected, its deposit is forfeited and divvied up as a reward amongst token holders who participated in the challenge process."

#### Claims > untested

* Candidates will not apply to the registry who believe they would obviously be rejected, as this would result in a financial loss for them.
* Token holders have a tactical incentive to challenge and reject every candidate to their registry in the interest of increasing their holdings, but this is at odds with their strategic interest of increasing the value of their holdings. [But] An empty list is of no interest to consumers, so candidates would not bother applying to it.

> In token-curated registries, the validators are the token holders.

# Question

How do you address the "cost of ownership" if I am a token holder. (short term / long term). How do you incentivize long term behavior?
Token holders have massive influence in this system > how do you pick/curate them? > they must be super knowledgeable in the domain to not get fooled?
How do you deal with token holders disagreements / internal fights?

Consumers | Candidates | Token holders

* consumers: pay to get info           (Most likely free | public data | db read only)
* candidates: pay to submit
* TH: Earn if one is rejected          (initial investment in buying token)
