Curation markets is a model that allow groups to more **effectively coordinate & earn** from value they **co-create around shared goals**.

> Every product/goal/idea/meme has an associated token of value that is used to **curate information**

* The groups can mint tokens without a central entity (for things like hashtags, memes, sub-reddits..)

* The price gets more expensive as more tokens are in circulation [How]?????
* The amount paid for the token is kept in a communal deposit [in a smart contract????]
