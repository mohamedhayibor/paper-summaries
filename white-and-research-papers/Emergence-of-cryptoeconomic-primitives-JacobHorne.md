[Emergence of Cryptoleconomic Primitives](https://medium.com/@jacobscott/the-emergence-of-cryptoeconomic-primitives-14ef3300cc10)

Primitive: well established, generic building blocks. They are designed to do one very specific task in a highly reliable fashion.

Cryptoeconomic primitive: protocol based incentives systems that are uniquely enabled by tokens. "tokenized economic games"

> Enable the coordination and allocation of capital to achieve a shared goal via the use of various economic and cryptographic mechanisms.

* self-sustaining system
* its intrinsic token must be a necessary element of that system
* predictable coordination of a set of actors towards a shared goal

Example: curation markets: a field of primitives specifically designed to curate information and reduce information asymmetry.

* TCRs: a binary outcome
* Curved bonding: a gradient score of the relevance of something

A cryptoeconomic primitive lets you easily instantiate a new human-computer organization out of the box.

* will contribute to the re-wiring of how society functions at large.
