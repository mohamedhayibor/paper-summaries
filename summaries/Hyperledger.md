> a protocol for b2b and b2c transactions.

### Claims

* allows for compliance with regulations, while supporting varied requirements when competing businesses work together on the same network.
* the distributed ledger makes it easy to create cost-efficient business networks (without a single point of control or every member with their own ledger then reconciling transaction updates).
* expect most of use cases to require permissioned blockchains. Round robin consensus might be sufficient for small highly trusted blockchains, while others might require Paxos, PBFT variants.
* support for modular, plug-and-play consensus.

### Problems for current blockchains

* scalibility challenges, lack of support for confidential / private transactions

> needs to be lightweight, modular and support extensibility through configuration and pluggability of various components (transaction validators, block consensus...)
