Applications of decentralized tech:

* identity verification
* smart property
* censorship resistant social platforms (subjectivity)
* codified governance
* autonomous structures


#### Main Scalibility Problem

> Every participating (full) node has to process all transactions.

Low transaction throughput - high degree of centralization


# Misc

Sometimes in papers `hash` and `checksum` refer to the same thing: cryptographic hash cheksums of data.


# Definitions

> MDAG: a DAG where links between objects are cryptographic hashes of the targets embedded in the sources.

payment channels: to establish p2p payment channels that allow 2 parties to privately maintain and update a two party ledger.
